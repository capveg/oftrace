WHAT: OpenFlow dump Analyzer/tracing
---------------------------
Take as input a libpcap formated file (i.e., from tcpdump/wireshark) and
output useful statistics about the OpenFlow session (defaults to port 6633)
liboftrace is available as a C library (liboftrace.{a,so}) and by higher
level programing languages, e.g., python, via swig.



HOW to build:
------------------------------
[if there is no ./configure script, i.e., building from git]
./boot.sh

./configure
	OR 
./configure --with-openflow-src-dir=/path/to/openflow/src

make
make install

to clean up all of the created files, run (mostly for developers):
./mr_proper.sh


TOOLS:
-----------------------------------
Included are two sample/example tools, written in both C and python:

ofdump: (python version: pyofdump.py)
	lists the messages and timestamps from a libpcap file

ofstats: (python version: pyofstats.py)
	prints the controller processing delay, i.e., the
	time between packet_in and corresponding packet_out or
	flow_mod
