WHAT: OpenFlow dump Analyzer/tracing
---------------------------
Take as input a libpcap formated file (i.e., from tcpdump/wireshark) and
output useful statistics about the OpenFlow session (defaults to port 6633)
liboftrace is available as a C library (liboftrace.{a,so}) and by higher
level programing languages, e.g., python, via swig.



HOW to build:
------------------------------
[if there is no ./configure script, i.e., building from git]
./boot.sh

./configure
	OR 
./configure --with-openflow-src-dir=/path/to/openflow/src

make
make install

to clean up all of the created files, run (mostly for developers):
./mr_proper.sh


TOOLS:
-----------------------------------
Included are two sample/example tools, written in both C and python:

ofdump: (python version: pyofdump.py)
	lists the messages and timestamps from a libpcap file

ofstats: (python version: pyofstats.py)
	prints the controller processing delay, i.e., the
	time between packet_in and corresponding packet_out or
	flow_mod 


Mac OS X support
----------------
liboftrace has been tested with Mac OS X. SWIG is required to build Python
support. It is recommended to use the MacPorts package management system to
install SWIG.

SWIG can be installed via MacPorts as follows:
   1. Download the latest version MacPorts
      (http://www.macports.org/install.php)
   2. Install MacPorts
   3. Open a terminal window and run:
        sudo port -v selfupdate
        sudo port install swig-python
