WHAT: OpenFlow dump Analyzer/tracing
---------------------------
Take as input a libpcap formated file (i.e., from tcpdump/wireshark) and
output useful statistics about the OpenFlow session (defaults to port 6633)



HOW to build:
------------------------------
[if there is no ./configure script, i.e., building from git]
./boot.sh

./configure
	OR 
./configure --with-openflow-src-dir=/path/to/openflow/src

make
make install

to clean up all of the created files, run (mostly for developers):
./mr_proper.sh
